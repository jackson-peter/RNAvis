# Multiple Transcripts Selection

In order to select your genes of interest, you can either select them from the field, or input a file containing one gene name per line. As FLEPseq2 needs only one isoform by gene, the isoform chosen here to represent all possible isoforms is the main one from the representative gene model.

The genes that are taken into account are then written underneath allowing to control which genes were found in the annotation file.
