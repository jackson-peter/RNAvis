# RNAvis

## Description

This R/Shiny application has been created to share the results of the FLEPseq2 experiments we performed in our lab and with the scientific community.

## Quick start

In order to use this application, follow these steps:

### 1. "Run selection tab":
Choose a FLEPseq2 experiment. The corresponding files will be loaded and some general informations about the run will appear on screen.
Some basic plots transcriptome-wide are displayed and won't be generated as the user is using the application, because some transcriptome-wide plot generation are computationnally intensive and can crash the server.
Should you need other representations or to explore the tables yourself, the data is available for download.

### 2. "Transcript Specific" or "Transcripts List" tab.
If you want to have more informations about one or several mRNAs, respectively.
