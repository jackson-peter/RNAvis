# Uridylation percentage threshold

In order to represent the number of uridylated tails compared to the non-uridylated ones, we need to set a threshold to distinguish between the two categories.
This uridylation percentage threshold is the percentage of U residues in the additional tail to be considered as a U-tail.

The reads that don't have any untemplated nucleotide addition other than the poly(A) tail are reported in the plot as 'no_additional_tail'
